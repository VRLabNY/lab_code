# Welcome to the Timewave VR Lab Git

Welcome! We'll be using the Git as a repository for simple code and sample projects.

If you have a piece of code contact *Maxwell Foxman* and he can upload it. Please provide a short description with the code and he will make similar Read Me files for it

# Access
In order to get access to the git to push your own commits, you should probably get a *github* account. Once you have one, an invite can be sent to you as a collaborator
